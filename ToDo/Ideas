TODO:
Processing neuron class:
- knows only about nearest neurons
#- randomly receives weak stimuli (to promote robustness and incentivize learning. if neuron learns, the random stimuli doesn't
#create as much chaos because existing strong connections can overlay the random noise)
#- alternatively trigger neuron when it's been inactive for too long
Connections:
- connecting:
    - after a few epochs of firing together with its neighbors, they wire together with a promoting connection (axon)
    - when neurons reliably fire together and are wired together, the connection gets stronger
- has inhibitory/promoting connections
- when signal of one promoting axon exceeds a threshold, all other axons transfer signal as well
    - stacked weak signals from multiple axons can also be added to exceed threshold
- when signal of one inhibitory axon exceeds a threshold, all other axons stop cannot be excited for a given timeframe
- all excitations happen over a short timeframe, after which the cell cannot be excited again
- connections get weaker when neuron is not used in a long time
- a connection is on cooldown after being depolarized (aka action potential)
Internal motivation:
- external forces can trigger pain
    - this pain triggers random axons of the neuron, creating chaos

Perceptive neuron class (visual):
- layered perceptive neurons that receive stimuli from the environment

Muscle neuron class (visual):
- neurons that are connected to muscles to manipulate the environment

Axon class:
- from which and to which cell
- how sensitive is the connection
- sensitivity, decay and delay get decreased when axon receives signal during cooldown or if triggered very often

Neuron space:
geometric dimension containing all cells



General architecture:
- perceptive layer that receives stimuli from the environment
- muscles which can be used to interact with the environment

Free energy principle:
- a deep neuron (middle between perception and muscles) gets triggered
- signal triggers muscle(s)
# this is not needed because it will learn anyway by being used
#- if the neuron gets triggered again after (short while but not too long, because it needs correlation) time has passed,
#the connections grow much stronger
- if neuron gets



Initialization:
- every neuron has at least two connections




Learning rule:
- when an axon is used frequently, the




TODO:
feed from perceptive and interaction at the same time. Do very often. If nothing much is changing go to next example
create a time interval, during which the network makes a step


Nacheinander die perceptive neurons aktivieren und danach "memory" durch:
- neuron bekommt signal
- neuron behält signal
- mit der zeit wird das signal schwächer
- wenn ein neuron ein zweites signal bekommt, werden die signale addiert

Wenn output getriggert wird, ohne dass output = label is, dann werden die
